                <p>
                    Ophirism: The philosophy that every ideology or "ism" holds truth when viewed from the correct perspective or interpreted in the right context. A person who follows this belief is known as an Ophirist.
		   An  Ophirist  would, therefore, be someone who navigates the world of ideas with an open mind, believing that each ideology offers a unique insight when understood from the proper vantage point.

                <p>
                    <strong>[ Apostle Dr.Addanki Swamidas Ranjeeth Ophir]</strong> is the visionary behind Ophir Ministries. born to a pious couple in 1959 and accepted Christ as his personal savior at a tender age of 6 under the prayerful guidance of his mother. He was filled with the Holy Spirit when he turned 10 and baptised in waters at 15. In 1980 when Pastor Ophir was an employee at Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), God urged him give up his job and serve Him fulltime. Obeying God’s command, Pastor Ophir began his ministry with half a rupee (less than $0.02). He faced much opposition from the non Christian religious fanatics often being beat, his bicycle and musical instruments being broken. Such incidents could not hamper his mission but strengthened him to experience God’s abundant grace as he continued steadfastly in the Lord.

Commissioned by the Lord to build a Church which is “the pillar and foundation of the truth” (1 Tim 3:15, NIV) and taught by the Lord to “correctly analyze and accurately divide the Word of Truth” (2 Tim 2:15, Amplified Bible) by employing correct methods of interpretation, Apostle Ophir is ready to teach and willing to learn. He exhorts everyone “to fight on for the faith which once and for all God has given to His people” (Jude 1:3, GNT). </p>
                <p>
                    Under their leadership, Ophir Ministries has grown into a community that celebrates open-mindedness..

    <h3>Vision</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="min1" class="ministry-description">
    <p>Ophir Ministries carries a special vision to educate and equip today's church with the essence essence of scripture and sound doctrine. Though it's the inexorable responsibility of every Christian to have a clear understanding of the Apostolic Teachings of the Bible, the Church of God today is in total confusion, but Lord Jesus takes no delight in confusion. Rev 2:20 says, "I have this against you" to the church at Thyatira which had all the good
qualities like love, patience and faithfulness. Today's Christian may boast of a satisfied spiritual life, involvement in evangelism, of being a Good Samaritan, but the Lord has "this against you" as long as "you tolerate woman
that Jezebel". Jezebel was responsible for bringing in the confusion among Israelites during Ahab's reign. She was dead, but now the same evil spirit which worked through her is very much active in the universal church and causing confusion and disunity among God's children. Our vision is to remove the doctrinal confusion from the Church of God so that the unity in Church is restored as it was in the first century</p>

    <h3>Faith Statement</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="min2" class="ministry-description">
<h4 align="left">God Head :</h4><br>
<p align="left"> We believe in One God, eternally existent in three persons called Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We believe that this triune God is the creator and sustainer and ruler of the whole Universe.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Sin :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe that there is no remission of sins without the shedding of sinless and holy blood according to Hebrews 9:22. And that this divine requirement was fulfilled by the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Blood of Christ :</h4><br>
<p align="left"> We believe in the efficacy of the Blood of Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the whole world. We believe that a person has to be born again, regenerated by the Holy Spirit and by the Word of the God in order to be saved from eternal hell.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">About Holy Spirit :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe that the anointing of the Holy Spirit is different from being regenerated by Holy Spirit. We believe that the Holy Spirit comes into the heart of the believer at the time of rebirth and He comes upon the believer at a later stage to give him power for a victorious and fruitful Christian life.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">The Bible :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe that the 66 books of the Protestant Bible are canonical and that they are the inspired Word of God.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Baptism :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe that water baptism is essential for salvation unless the believing person is incapable of being baptized. We believe that immersing the believer totally in the waters, after he repents from his sinful life, intelligently believes in the Gospel and receives the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal savior, is baptism. We believe that an infant baptism and sprinkling is no baptism at all.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Communication :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe in the great commission entrusted to the Church as recorded in Mark 16:16 and Matt 25:18, 19 which involves preaching the Gospel, baptizing the believers and indoctrinating them.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Great Commission :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe in the great commission entrusted to the Church as recorded in Mark 16:16 and Matt 25:18, 19 which involves preaching the Gospel, baptizing the believers and indoctrinating them.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Gifts Of Holy Spirit :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe in the 9 gifts of the Holy Spirit which are still operating in the Church today. We believe that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit shall continue to operate in the body of the Christ until the day of
the rapture.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Second Comming :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe in the second coming of our Lord. We believe that the Lord will return to the mid air and receive His bride, the Church unto Himself and take her to the Father's house.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Resurrections :</h4><br>
<p align="left">We believe in two universal general The first being the resurrections. of the just and the second being the resurrection of the unjust and the unsaved. We believe that the resurrection occurring at the sounding of the last trumpet as mentioned in I Corinthians 15:52 is the first resurrection which is the resurrection of the saved.Because all Christian martyrs killed under the rule of antichrist will be resurrected in the first resurrection according to Revelations 20:4& 5. We believe that the Church will be on earth during the time of antichrist's rule.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Rapture :</h4><br>
<p align="left">Because of this observation we believe that the rapture of the Church will be in the middle of the 70th week of Daniel, amid the great tribulation. We believe that there will be no rapture until the completion of the first 3½ years of the great tribulation.</p><br>

<h4 align="left">Offices of the Church :</h4><br>
<p>We believe that the Apostles, prophets, pastors, evangelists and teachers are the special gifts of God for His Church and that these four or five offices shall continue to operate in the body of Christ till the Lord's return.</p><br>

    <h3>Apologetics</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="min3" class="ministry-description">
    <p>Apostle Ophir, being a voracious reader, finished studying the Bible 125 times, the Vedas over 70 times and the Quran more than 20 times. His insatiable hunger for knowledge made him read more than 1000 volumes of books from all kinds you find in the present-day literature. Apo. Dr. A S Ranjeet Ophir has been a part of many debates and has given many sermons amidst Hindu Scholars, Buddhist Monks, Jain Intellectuals and Islam friends.His recent work Haindava Kristhavam (Hindu - Christianity) is receiving rave reviews from many Hindus who, through this book have found Christ as the Only God of this universe. This remarkable book brings to light, an enormous treasure trove of revelation of Christ that's hidden in these classic Hindu Scriptures. Establishing the Divinity of Christ by quoting Vedas Vedas is laurelled by the spiritually enlightened. This book proves that all the Hindu Mythology is nothing but an allegorical presentation of the true Gospel of Christ and as such there's no real contradiction between Hinduism and Christianity. While offering a reasonable explanation to all the mythological stories of Hinduism paying due respects to the ancient Hindu religion, Apostle Ophir uncompromisingly proves and establishes that Christ in fact is the one and only Savior of mankind. This is in perfect agreement with the Pauline policy announced in Acts 17:23, "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.". We believe that this book will convince every Indian and even every genuine seeker of truth from
all over the world that Jesus is the true Way of Salvation. We also engage ourselves in friendly debates, open discussions, Live phone in programs and Q&A sessions with students on all the topics that are prevailing in the
minds of the Thinker and the Atheist. We praise God that He has enabled us to answer any sort of question that arises in the human mind. If it is pro-Bible, or if it questions God's moral responsibility, we are ready to gear ourselves up and our Lead Apostle Ophir will be answering all those questions

    <p>Burdened to reach out to the perishing souls, we carry the Good News of the Gospel to the extremely remote villages of India without neglecting major towns and cities. God in His plenteous grace has
blessed this ministry without bounds. As we continue to expand every day, our commitment to spread the love of Christ, to the whole world has hit a new peak. It would be quite an understatement to say that thousands of non Christians have embraced Christ as their Savior through our relentless efforts. Specifically guided by the Lord, we've christened the Churches that are formed with these newly saved souls, as Agape Full Gospel Churches.
These Churches address the spiritual
needs of persons of all age groups.</p>

RKP is aiming to combat countrywide
false propaganda against the gospel &
Christian community, to demand the
government to take up responsibility of
rebuilding it or compensating for the loss.

inculcate the essence of all religions

  <div id="org3" class="organization-description">
    <p>Agape Child Evangelism
Pastor Ophir, being saved at a tender
age of 6, has a special drive in his heart to
bring the little ones to the Lord. This has
been brought into reality through Agape
Child Evangelism Clubs (ACE Clubs).
As our Lord Jesus said, "Let the little
children come to me, and do not hinder
them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs
to such as these" (Matt 19:14, NIV), we
are keen to mould the little hearts to
accept Christ as their Savior at a very
young age. Our child evangelism involves
touching these tiny tots by first
understanding them properly and then
communicating the Gospel in the right
way at the right time, backed up with a lot
of prayer.We've been successful in this ministry
with the result being this, almost 99% of
our Sunday school children accept Christ
between 6 to 10 years of age and get
immersion water baptized before they
turn 15 and continue steadfastly in the
Lord.In short our Agape Child Evangelism is a seed well sown, watered by God! Our ACE Clubs are blooming rapidly by the unwavering commitment and dedication of ACE teacher and volunteers under the prayerful guidance of Apo. Dr. A S Ranjeet Ophir.</p>

    <p>The Lord commissioned Apo. Dr. A S.
Ranjeet Ophir in 1982 to write 9 specific
books. He saw a vision of God's hand
displaying the cover page and index of
each book to be written. The Lord
announced that through this literature
He'd bring the process of reformation
started by Dr Martin Luther in the
universal church to a close.
After much argument with the Lord,
like Moses on Mt Horeb, Apostle Ophir
gave in to the Lord's will and has already
come up with 8 of his books, published in
his native language, Telugu. Two of his
books, Is God A Trinity and Did God
Create Satan, have been translated into
English recently. Very shortly these books,
rich with the revelation of God, will be published in English and a few other
widely spoken languages of the world.
Apart from these thousands of
anointed sermons delivered by Apostle
Ophir are available in Telugu, Hindi and
English in both YouTube and Facebook.</p>

for me." (Matthew 25:35, 36, 40). even
with our limited resources we are
discharging the primary duty of a
Christian.
A few of our church elders pledge a
part of their earnings, enabling us to run
this enormous task. We, like the
Macedonian church, even in our poverty
would like to carry on this noble human
activity.</p>
