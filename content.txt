***The term "Ophirism" was coined by Apostle Dr. Addanki Ranjeerth Ophir, a Christian theologian and philosopher from India. Ophir developed his philosophy as a way to reconcile the different religious and philosophical traditions that he had studied, including Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism.***


*** Definition: A philosophy that seeks to interpret the different religious and philosophical traditions in a way that emphasizes their commonalities and promotes interfaith understanding.***


***STATEMENT***
--------------------------
***"Ophirism asserts that all ideologies, systems of belief, or 'isms' hold truth within them when approached with the right understanding or perspective. It posits that the validity of any belief system is not inherent, but rather depends on the angle from which it is interpreted. In this way, no single ideology claims absolute dominance;  Those who embrace this way of thinking are called *Ophirists*. They believe in the transformative power of understanding, seeing value in diverse perspectives and the plurality of human thought."
An *Ophirist* would, therefore, be someone who navigates the world of ideas with an open mind, believing that each ideology offers a unique insight when understood from the proper vantage point.***

####Ophirism is the belief that all ideologies or 'isms' are valid when understood or interpreted from the right perspective. It suggests that the truth of any belief system depends on the angle of interpretation rather than the ideology itself. A person who subscribes to this philosophy is called an Ophirist. They believe that every ideology can hold truth when viewed through the correct lens.####



***ABOUT***
--------------------
Ophir Ministries was born due to God's burning anger towards the teachings which are contrary to the essence of the Scriptures. Those teachings have created disunity and hatred among the Christians, thus splitting them into innumerable denominations. What a contrast to the times when the apostles of the first century ministered! where everybody who accepted Christ believed just one thing, gloriously pleasant unity reigned
throughout the Church!!
Deeply motivated by God, to bring back this blessed unity into the Church, by driving away the doctrinal chaos, Apo. A S Ranjeet Ophir laid the foundation stone for Ophir Ministries.
Everything started by God will always have a humble beginning. God blessed Ophir Ministries in the way "A little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation." (Isaiah 60:22, KJV). As time progressed God made Ophir Ministries snowball into a mammoth organization of 1000+ Churches counting every day, incorporating numerous other facets in itself. Come be a part of Ophir Ministries!


***VISION***
--------------------
 Ophir Ministries carries a special vision to educate and equip today's church with the essence essence of scripture and sound doctrine. Though it's the inexorable responsibility of every Christian to have a clear understanding of the Apostolic Teachings of the Bible, the Church of God today is in total confusion, but Lord Jesus takes no delight in confusion. Rev 2:20 says, "I have this against you" to the church at Thyatira which had all the good qualities like love, patience and faithfulness. Today's Christian may boast of a satisfied spiritual life, involvement in evangelism, of being a Good Samaritan, but the Lord has "this against you" as long as "you tolerate woman that Jezebel". Jezebel was responsible for bringing in the confusion among Israelites during Ahab's reign. She was dead, but now the same evil spirit which worked through her is very much active in the universal church and causing confusion and disunity among God's children. Our vision is to remove the doctrinal confusion from the Church of God so that the unity in Church is restored as it was in the first century.

faith statement
---------------------


God Head

We believe in One God, eternally existent in three persons called Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We believe that this triune God is the creator and sustainer and ruler of the whole Universe.

Sin

We believe that there is no remission of sins without the shedding of sinless and holy blood according to Hebrews 9:22. And that this divine requirement was fulfilled by the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross.

Blood of Christ

We believe in the efficacy of the Blood of Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the whole world. We believe that a person has to be born again, regenerated by the Holy Spirit and by the Word of the God in order to be saved from eternal hell.

About Holy Spirit

We believe that the anointing of the Holy Spirit is different from being regenerated by Holy Spirit. We believe that the Holy Spirit comes into the heart of the believer at the time of rebirth and He comes upon the believer at a later stage to give him power for a victorious and fruitful Christian life.

The Bible

We believe that the 66 books of the Protestant Bible are canonical and that they are the inspired Word of God.

Baptism

We believe that water baptism is essential for salvation unless the believing person is incapable of being baptized. We believe that immersing the believer totally in the waters, after he repents from his sinful life, intelligently believes in the Gospel and receives the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal savior, is baptism. We believe that an infant baptism and sprinkling is no baptism at all.

Communion

We believe in the great commission entrusted to the Church as recorded in Mark 16:16 and Matt 25:18, 19 which involves preaching the Gospel, baptizing the believers and indoctrinating them.

Great Commission

We believe in the great commission entrusted to the Church as recorded in Mark 16:16 and Matt 25:18, 19 which involves preaching the Gospel, baptizing the believers and indoctrinating them.

Gifts of the Holy Spirit

We believe in the 9 gifts of the Holy Spirit which are still operating in the Church today. We believe that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit shall continue to operate in the body of the Christ until the day of
the rapture.

Second Coming

We believe in the second coming of our Lord. We believe that the Lord will return to the mid air and receive His bride, the Church unto Himself and take her to the Father's house.

Resurrections

We believe in two universal general The first being the resurrections. of the just and the second being the resurrection of the unjust and the unsaved. We believe that the resurrection occurring at the sounding of the last trumpet as mentioned in I Corinthians 15:52 is the first resurrection which is the resurrection of the saved.Because all Christian martyrs killed under the rule of antichrist will be resurrected in the first resurrection according to Revelations 20:4& 5. We believe that the Church will be on earth during the time of antichrist's rule.


Rapture

Because of this observation we believe that the rapture of the Church will be in the middle of the 70th week of Daniel, amid the great tribulation. We believe that there will be no rapture until the completion of the first 3½ years of the great tribulation.

Offices of the Church

We believe that the Apostles, prophets, pastors, evangelists and teachers are the special gifts of God for His Church and that these four or five offices shall continue to operate in the body of Christ till the Lord's return.





Apologetics
------------------

Apostle Ophir, being a voracious reader, finished studying the Bible 125 times, the Vedas over 70 times and the Quran more than 20 times. His insatiable hunger for knowledge made him read more than 1000 volumes of books from all kinds you find in the present-day literature. Apo. Dr. A S Ranjeet Ophir has been a part of many debates and has given many sermons amidst Hindu Scholars, Buddhist Monks, Jain Intellectuals and Islam friends.His recent work Haindava Kristhavam (Hindu - Christianity) is receiving rave reviews from many Hindus who, through this book have found Christ as the Only God of this universe. This remarkable book brings to light, an enormous treasure trove of revelation of Christ that's hidden in these classic Hindu Scriptures. Establishing the Divinity of Christ by quoting Vedas Vedas is laurelled by the spiritually enlightened. This book proves that all the Hindu Mythology is nothing but an allegorical presentation of the true Gospel of Christ and as such there's no real contradiction between Hinduism and Christianity. While offering a reasonable explanation to all the mythological stories of Hinduism paying due respects to the ancient Hindu religion, Apostle Ophir uncompromisingly proves and establishes that Christ in fact is the one and only Savior of mankind. This is in perfect agreement with the Pauline policy announced in Acts 17:23, "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.". We believe that this book will convince every Indian and even every genuine seeker of truth from
all over the world that Jesus is the true Way of Salvation. We also engage ourselves in friendly debates, open discussions, Live phone in programs and Q&A sessions with students on all the topics that are prevailing in the
minds of the Thinker and the Atheist. We praise God that He has enabled us to answer any sort of question that arises in the human mind. If it is pro-Bible, or if it questions God's moral responsibility, we are ready to gear ourselves up and our Lead Apostle Ophir will be answering all those questions
